                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                I am Diego Ascânio Santos, a professor at CEFET-MG, Divinópolis campus. My background is in Computer Engineering, and I hold a master's degree in Computational Mathematical Modeling. My academic interests span across multiple fields, including electrical circuit analysis, microprocessors, and digital systems. I am passionate about applying both theoretical and practical techniques to solve complex problems in these areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                In my teaching career, I strive to help students develop skills in understanding and analyzing both DC and AC circuits, applying techniques like Kirchhoff’s laws, Thévenin and Norton theorems, as well as exploring the intricacies of first- and second-order circuit responses. Outside of the classroom, I actively engage in open-source development, where I contribute tools and educational resources related to my areas of expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                I also teach computing fundamentals, including programming languages like C and Python, as well as microcontroller programming. I am always looking for new ways to engage students in the learning process, and I am excited to share my knowledge and experience with the next generation of engineers. With a focus on developing new approaches to teaching and learning, I am dedicated to empowering students to explore complex concepts through real-world applications and collaborative projects.
                </p>
